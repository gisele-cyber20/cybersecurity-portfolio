# 📄 Access Control Policy Documentation

## Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a structured Access Control Policy aligned with cybersecurity best practices and the principle of least privilege.  

The objective is to define standards for user authentication, authorization, account lifecycle management, and privilege control within an organizational environment.

---

## 🔹 Purpose

To ensure that access to systems, applications, and sensitive data is granted based on business need, minimized risk exposure, and properly monitored throughout the user lifecycle.

---

## 🔹 Scope

This policy applies to:

- Employees
- Contractors
- Third-party vendors
- All systems and applications within the organization

---

## 🔹 Policy Requirements

### 1️⃣ Account Provisioning
- All user accounts must be approved by management.
- Access must be role-based.
- Unique user IDs are required (no shared accounts).

### 2️⃣ Authentication Controls
- Minimum password length: 12 characters
- Complexity requirements enforced
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for privileged accounts
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts

### 3️⃣ Authorization & Least Privilege
- Access granted strictly on business need
- Administrative privileges reviewed quarterly
- Segregation of duties enforced

### 4️⃣ Account Review Process
- Monthly review of privileged accounts
- Annual review of all user accounts
- Immediate deprovisioning upon termination

### 5️⃣ Logging & Monitoring
- Authentication attempts logged
- Privileged activity monitored
- Audit logs retained for minimum 90 days

## 🔹 Risk Mitigation Impact

Proper access control reduces:

- Insider threat risk
- Privilege escalation risk
- Unauthorized data exposure
- Credential misuse
- Regulatory compliance failures

---

## 🔹 Alignment With Security Frameworks

This policy aligns with:

- NIST Access Control (AC) family
- CIS Controls
- Principle of Least Privilege
- CIA Triad (Confidentiality & Integrity)

---

## 🔹 Key Takeaways

This project reinforces the importance of structured access governance, continuous monitoring, and role-based control models in maintaining a secure enterprise environment.
